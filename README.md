# VoldeNuitFramework

VoldeNuitFramework is an **UNOFFICIAL** additional framework of the
 [MonoGameFramework](https://monogame.net/)
 start for the migration of Gamemaker:Studio < 2.  

</br></br>

# Features

Basic concepts like Sprite, Instance, Rooms, etc. have been implemented to make MonoGame easier to use.

- Sprite
    - If the extension of your texture file is .png or .xnb, it is automatically tracked and loaded.

- Font
    - If you have a font file, the font texture is automatically created, and it can be used in the game immediately.

- Instance
    - You can easily manage the Instance by inheriting the default Instance class.
    - Basic movement calculation and collision check are provided.

- Drawing
    - Drawing methods make it easy to display Sprite and textures on the screen.

- Room
    - Basic Camera, View and Viewport are provided.
    - By creating the Instance, it is automatically tracked and managed.

- Sound
    - If the extension of your audio file is .wav or .xnb, it is automatically tracked and loaded.
    - 3D audio effects are provided.

... and more!
